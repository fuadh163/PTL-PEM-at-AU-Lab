In this study, the challenge was addressed by stochastic models of 3D PTLs having been utilized, a CNN model having been constructed to predict the structural and transport properties of the PTL, with the aim of computational modeling costs being minimized and overall efficiency and performance being enhanced. Consequently, a CNN model with high accuracy in property prediction was engineered to reduce computational expenses, with modeling tasks having been bypassed and synthetic images having been directly input into the model to achieve highly accurate results.

In prior work, customized multi-layer PTLs were crafted, with a reduced fiber radius on the catalyst side and an enlarged fiber radius on the flow-field side having been featured.
The benefits of both fiber sizes were capitalized on by this configuration, with gas removal, electrical conductivity, and heat dissipation having been optimized while robust surface contact area and minimized roughness were preserved.
Fiber properties and PTL geometry were fine-tuned, with scalable, optimized PTL models suitable for real-time PEM electrolyzer systems in renewable energy applications having been created.
With computational costs aimed to be reduced, a deep learning model was endeavored to be developed, poised for integration into a PTL optimization framework.
Synthetic images were produced to facilitate training, testing, and validation of the model.
A high-accuracy model was ultimately formulated, with optimization initiatives having been bolstered.
