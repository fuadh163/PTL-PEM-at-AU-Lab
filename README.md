##PTL-PEM-at-AU-Lab

This repository contains synthetic image data and a CNN model related to porous transport layers (PTLs) for proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. The objective of this work is to reduce computational modeling costs by using deep learning to predict structural and transport properties of PTLs.
The data includes:
1) 10 sets of synthetic PTL images
2) Each set contains 300 randomly normalized images with fixed fiber diameter, spacing, and porosity
3) An elementary convolutional neural network (CNN) code for property prediction

The PTL images were generated to represent stochastic 3D structures used in PEM electrolyzer systems. The CNN model was trained to accurately predict their structural and transport properties, bypassing traditional computational modeling.
This study was carried out at the AU Lab with a focus on scalable PTL optimization for renewable energy applications.
